How We are taking Peer Review feedback into account for our final project:

The main concern expressed by our peer reviewers was that our documentation needed an update. Thankfully and peer reviewer was kind enough to add the changes that they saw fit but we must also make sure our instructions for running our project are as explicit as possible and leave as little room for error as we can. Another popular suggestion/feedback has been adding a execute code button. We are looking into possible solutions right now as to why we get an object promise when we use our run code button or how to implement the node.js compiler which is necessary for the API calls to run correctly. One possible solution is to run the compiler on a server and return the result from the server and the other is to try and find a node.js api that can handle running the compiler on our current front end without the networks. This will also lessen the first criticism since the project will have less steps that are necessary for you to get started and run code. The last piece of feedback was the the search does not run if you search for an empty string to remedy this we will add a default string on the text input box so that was if someone does not type they will still atleast search something.
