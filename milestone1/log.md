# Group Contributions 

## Contribution Details

In this file, we describe how we have divided up our work so far as well as the links associated with the files we each have contributed to.

As we researched our project ideas and began to document our planned layout and implementation, we all were able to split up the workload fairly evenly. We communicate through a group chat and divided up the assignment and/or sections of the assignments to make sure everyone was able to put some work in. 

As we have gotten into the implementation and the coding of the project, we have had to do more research than coding in order to understand how the Nutrionix API and the Blockly API should work together. Kyle originally set up the repository, the github.ip page, and the basic outline of the blockly page. Natalie and Lauren worked together to set up the toolbox for the blockly page. 

In terms of this milestone, Kyle and Natalie both did some research and tested how to use the Nutritionix API. Kyle was able to attend some office hours that solved our object promise issue. He was able to then implement some blocks that successfully used the search API call. Natalie and Lauren then cleaned up the organization of the milestone 1 folder and created/updated all of the documentation. 

## AI Contribution

We have AI, specifically ChatGPT, in the process of understanding how the APIs and the API calls we are using function. Personally (coming from natalie), I have limited experience with working with javascript, github.io, etc. so I was able to use AI to help give me context on how to structure our code, what files are needed, etc. I also used it to help me undestand, for example, how an API and an API call works. So, AI was used in the process of this project so far. However, all code has been written by members of the group or taken from the example repository from Professor Kurz.
