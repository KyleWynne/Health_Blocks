# Health Blocks Midterm Demo

## Instructions 
To recreate the demo, follow the below instructions: <br />
Go to GitHub the Pages Deployment: [Here](https://kylewynne.github.io/Health_Blocks/) <br />
if running on your machine, navigate to index.html in your filesystem, double-click, and open with the browser of your choice <br />

use the blocks to create code. Our recommended test is: <br />

set up nutritionix API <br />
Search foods -> Text Input: apple <br />
Print Calories -> Calorie Sum (300, Calorie Sum (300, 400) <br />

hit generate javascript <br />
hit export javascript <br />

now you have a file called code.js; this code was designed to be run with the node.js Java compiler. <br />
if you do not have the node.js java compiler, find further information here: https://nodejs.org/en/download <br />

once installed, you'll want to add the node-fetch package. To install node-fetch, open a terminal window and run "npm install node-fetch" <br />

then you can run the code in the command line with: node code.js <br />
