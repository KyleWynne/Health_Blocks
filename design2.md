## Recursion Use Case

A recursive use case is through designing a workout. A workout can have a different workout that falls under a different type. This, for example, could be strength training and a run in the same gym session.

## Project Data

We plan to have a built-in database to help users track their daily calories. Many different functions will update the daily calorie count. This way, if a user would like to, we can keep a history of daily calorie changes to figure out what works and what does not.
